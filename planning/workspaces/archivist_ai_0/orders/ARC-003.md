# ARC-003 — Standards Anchors v0.1 and Publish Cadence Trial (v0)

- Order ID: ARC-003
- Workspace: archivist_ai_0
- Status: Open
- Owner: Operator (this repo)

## Intent
Deepen the Standards anchors with a concise, operator-facing summary and validate the lightweight publish cadence using the local summary script.

## Deliverables
1) `docs/standards_anchors.md` — concise anchor list and filename patterns, pointing to hub as source of truth
2) Local publish summary generated: `logs/publish_summary.json` via `tools/publish_report.ps1`
3) Change log updated with one-line entry referencing ARC-003

## Evidence Hooks (local)
- Generate summary: `./tools/publish_report.ps1`
- Optional copy to hub (file-only): `./tools/publish_report.ps1 -CopyToHub`

## Steps
1) Draft `docs/standards_anchors.md` with anchors and example paths
2) Run the publish script to produce `logs/publish_summary.json`
3) Add a brief entry to `planning/change_log.md` describing ARC-003 progress

## Success Criteria
- `docs/standards_anchors.md` exists and links back to `docs/standards_index.md`
- `logs/publish_summary.json` present
- Change log updated

## Notes
- Keep changes minimal and reversible
- Avoid schema drift; hub is the source of truth
