# ARC-001 — Stand up Standards/Runbook Indexes and Evidence Hooks (v0)

- Order ID: ARC-001
- Workspace: archivist_ai_0
- Status: Open
- Owner: Operator (this repo)

## Intent
Finalize v0 of the operator-facing indexes and validate local evidence hooks without requiring network access.

## Deliverables
1) `docs/standards_index.md` — v0 baseline present and linked
2) `docs/runbook_index.md` — v0 baseline present and linked
3) `docs/publish_plan.md` — v0 baseline present and linked
4) Evidence: `logs/heartbeat.json` and `logs/sync.json` created via tools (ignored by git)
5) Draft completion report: `planning/reports/ARC-001-completion.md`

## Evidence Hooks (local)
- Heartbeat: `./tools/heartbeat.ps1` (writes `logs/heartbeat.json`)
- Sync (dry-run): `./tools/sync_exchange.ps1` (writes `logs/sync.json`)
- Optional env: `$env:SHAGI_EXCHANGE_PATH = 'C:\\Users\\Admin\\high_command_exchange'`

## Steps
1) Verify relative links resolve in:
   - `docs/runbook_index.md`
   - `docs/standards_index.md`
   - `docs/publish_plan.md`
2) Run heartbeat and sync wrappers; confirm JSON files exist under `logs/`.
3) Fill `planning/reports/ARC-001-completion.md` using the template; include file sizes/timestamps for evidence.
4) If desired, copy a JSON report to hub using `SHAGI_EXCHANGE_PATH` (manual step, file copy only).

## Success Criteria
- All three index docs exist and link correctly locally.
- Evidence JSON present under `logs/` (ignored by git).
- Completion report drafted with next actions.

## Attachments
- `../../../docs/standards_index.md`
- `../../../docs/runbook_index.md`
- `../../../docs/publish_plan.md`

## Notes
- Keep changes minimal and reversible.
- No secrets in repo.
- Prefer file-based hub interactions; avoid network.
