# Code of Conduct

Archivist maintainers steward this genesis workspace for the Genesis Workspaces program. We operate within the SHAGI doctrine of responsible collaboration and expect every contributor—human or machine—to uphold the following principles:

- **Respect and empathy.** Engage with others constructively; harassment, hostility, or discrimination of any kind will not be tolerated.
- **Evidence-first transparency.** Ground proposals in current sources of truth, reference relevant orders or ledger entries, and keep doc maps and indices in sync so operators can audit changes quickly.
- **Safety and stewardship.** Follow the guardrails documented in `docs/standards_index.md`, `RUNBOOK.md`, and linked guidance before executing impactful actions; escalate early if a safeguard looks out of date.
- **Accountability.** Own your contributions. If mistakes occur, report them quickly, capture evidence in `logs/` when helpful, and work to remediate the issue.
- **Continuous learning.** Offer feedback graciously, accept feedback openly, and improve the shared doctrine together.

Violations may result in warnings, temporary restrictions, or removal of access.

To report misconduct, contact the Archivist maintainers at `archivist_maintainers@shagi.daylands` or coordinate through the workspace planning index at `planning/workspaces/archivist_ai_0/`.
